Top 5 Priorities for opshop.online

Fix Server-Side Delays and 503 Errors (System Performance)

Why: Slow checkout page load times (4-5 seconds) and occasional 503 Service Unavailable errors frustrate users and lead to cart abandonment, directly hurting sales. Reliable performance is critical for an e-commerce site.

Action: Investigate server capacity and optimize backend processes (e.g., database queries). Enable caching (e.g., via Cloudflare) and consider upgrading hosting to handle traffic spikes. Test checkout under load to ensure stability.

Impact: Faster, reliable checkout increases conversions and user trust.
Implement Real-Time Inventory Sync (Logic Error)

Why: Products listed as “Available” but marked “Out of Stock” at checkout confuse users and erode trust, especially for a second-hand clothing site where items are unique.

Action: Integrate real-time inventory updates between the front-end and backend systems. Display low-stock warnings (e.g., “Only 1 left!”) on product pages to set expectations.

Impact: Reduces checkout errors, improves user satisfaction, and prevents lost sales.
Fix Broken Links and 404 Errors (Broken Links)

Why: Broken product links in the “Featured Items” section and external links on the “Partner Charities” page create dead ends, frustrating users and harming SEO.

Action: Use a tool like Screaming Frog to audit all internal and external links. Fix or redirect broken product links to similar items and update the outdated Twitter/X link in the footer. Schedule monthly link checks.

Impact: Enhances user experience and improves search engine rankings.
Add Advanced Search Filters (Functionality)

Why: The current search lacks filters for size, color, or price, making it harder for users to find relevant second-hand clothing, which can reduce engagement and sales.

Action: Implement filters for key attributes (e.g., size, color, condition, price range) on search and category pages. Ensure filters are mobile-friendly and intuitive.

Impact: Improves usability, keeps users on the site longer, and boosts purchase likelihood.
Optimize Image Sizes for Faster Load Times (System Performance)

Why: Large, unoptimized images on product pages slow load times (4-5 seconds), especially on mobile, leading to higher bounce rates and lower SEO rankings.

Action: Compress images using tools like TinyPNG and enable lazy loading for images below the fold. Test page load times with tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to target under 2 seconds.

Impact: Faster pages improve user experience, reduce bounce rates, and enhance SEO.


Why These Priorities?
These five actions address the most urgent issues affecting user trust (e.g., broken links, inventory errors), site performance (e.g., server delays, image optimization), and usability (e.g., search filters). They were prioritized over others (e.g., accessibility, discount logic) because they directly impact core e-commerce goals: conversions, retention, and reliability. Fixing these will create a stronger foundation for further improvements.
