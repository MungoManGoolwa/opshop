## System Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
The application uses a unified TypeScript codebase with three main directories:
- `client/` - React frontend with Vite build system
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Common schemas and types used by both frontend and backend

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color scheme supporting light/dark modes
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless) - **ACTIVE**
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with OpenID Connect
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Storage Layer**: DatabaseStorage implementation using Drizzle ORM queries

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Server-side sessions stored in PostgreSQL
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin, moderator, customer, seller, business)
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Profile management with role-based permissions
- **Products**: Listings with categories, conditions, pricing, and media
- **Categories**: Hierarchical product categorization
- **Wishlists**: User favorite items tracking
- **Messages**: Communication between buyers and sellers
- **Commissions**: Transaction fee tracking
- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

### API Design
- **RESTful endpoints**: Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- **Route organization**: Grouped by feature (auth, products, categories, etc.)
- **Middleware**: Request logging, error handling, and authentication checks
- **Data validation**: Zod schemas for request/response validation

### UI Components
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- **Icon System**: Lucide React icons throughout the interface

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User clicks login â†’ redirected to Replit Auth
2. Successful authentication creates/updates user in database
3. Session stored in PostgreSQL with user information
4. Frontend receives user data through protected API endpoint

### Product Listing Flow
1. Authenticated users can create product listings
2. Data validated using Zod schemas
3. Products stored with seller information and category association
4. Images handled through local file storage system

### Search and Discovery
1. Products fetched through paginated API endpoints
2. Filtering by category, condition, price range, and location
3. Real-time search implementation (planned)
4. Category-based navigation for improved discovery
